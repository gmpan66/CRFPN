# CRFPN
A weighted converging and radiating feature pyramid network

This project is based on [mmdetection-3.3.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

- The source code of CRFPN is located in `mmdetection/mmdet/models/necks/crfpn.py`. Besides, remember to make changes to the `__init__.py` file.

- The configuration files are stored in the `mmdetection/configs/crfpn/` directory. This directory contains configuration files for two frameworks: RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN.
